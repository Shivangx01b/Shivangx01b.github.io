## How I bypassed 2fa in a 3 years old private program!

When I was invited to this private program say "private.com" I was bit discouraged as it was 3 years old program with only 3 eligible scope and many hackers must have hammered it hard and  I thought that finding a bug here is just a waste of time.

But any way I started IDK why ...FFF..

So after doing some dirsearch I found 2 open redirects in like ~ 3 mins...But got a duplicate when I submitted the report.

Then I jumped to app.private.com to try some auth flaws and with a hope that no one looked here even though it's a 3 year old program...just in case ?

After trying many things I decided to try some rate limit checks on login and 2fa things ...Both login and 2fa where protected from google captcha :/

So I tried to remove the header which was checking the captcha from the request just to see if there is not client side checks but login blocked me with "Invalid Captcha"...But 2fa didn't and I was able to send any many 6 digits code as I want to !
