## It's my first post regarding bug hunting...So..Anyway let's start !

When I was invited to this private program say "private.com" I was bit discouraged as it was 3 years old program with only 3 eligible scope and many hackers must have hammered it hard and  I thought that finding a bug here is just a waste of time.

But any way I started IDK why ...FFF..

So after doing some dirsearch I found 2 open redirects in like ~ 3 mins...But got a duplicate when I submitted the report ;__;
