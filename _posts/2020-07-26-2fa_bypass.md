## How I bypassed 2fa in a 3 years old private program!

When I was invited to this private program say "private.com" I was bit discouraged as it was 3 years old program with only 3 eligible scope and I thought that many hackers must have hammered it hard and finding a bug here would just be a waste of time.

But any way I started IDK why ...FFF..

So after doing some dirsearch I found 2 open redirects in like ~ 3 mins...But got a duplicate when I submitted the report.

Then I jumped to app.private.com to try some auth flaws and with a hope that no one ever looked here even though it's a 3 year old program...just in case ?

After trying some things I decided to try some rate limit checks on login and 2fa things ...Both login and 2fa where protected from google captcha :/

So I tried to remove the captcha header from the request to see if web app is blocking any client side changes...and login request gave me "Invalid Captcha"...But 2fa didn't !

- Request with no google captcha headers
